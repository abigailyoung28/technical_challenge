          <p>Orangutans used to roam as far north as southern China, and as far
            south as the Indonesian island of Java. Today they’re only found on
            two islands – Sumatra and Borneo.
            Orangutans are known as gardeners of the forest, because they help
            spread seeds around. Without that seed distribution, the forests
            would be drastically different, and that would have impacts on all
            the people and animals that live in or use those forests.
            The people of Borneo and Sumatra depend on the orang-utan’s forest
            for food, water, income and environmental protection.
            There’s nothing wrong with palm oil. Lots of everyday products,
            from snacks to soaps, use it. The problem is how it’s grown.
            As consumers in the UK we can all help by demanding that the palm
            oil used in our local supermarkets only comes from Roundtable on
            Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified sources. </p>
