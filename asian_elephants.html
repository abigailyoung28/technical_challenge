          <div class="leftText">
          <p>The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian
            continent. They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats
            in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While
            they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted
            to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.
            The biggest threat to Asian elephants is habitat loss and
            fragmentation. Asia is the most populous continent on Earth,
            where development and economic growth have led to encroachment
            into places where elephants live. This has led to an average of
            70% of elephants being found outside protected areas today.
            Expanding human settlements, plantations, industry, farming,
            mining, and linear infrastructure (roads, railway lines,
            irrigation canals, etc.) have squeezed elephant populations
            into smaller pockets of forest surrounded by human settlements
            that often block traditional migratory routes.</p>
