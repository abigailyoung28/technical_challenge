        <section class="text_section">
          <div class="leftText">
          <p>Leatherback turtles are named for their shell, which is leather-like
            rather than hard, like other turtles. They are the largest sea turtle
            species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic
            and Pacific Oceans. Pacific leatherbacks migrate from nesting beaches
            in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to feed on
            the abundant jellyfish every summer and fall. Although their distribution
            is wide, numbers of leatherback turtles have seriously declined during the
            last century as a result of intense egg collection and fisheries bycatch.
            Globally, leatherback status according to IUCN is listed as Vulnerable,
            but many subpopulations (such as in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic)
            are Critically Endangered. Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of sea turtles
            a year are accidentally caught in shrimp trawl nets, on longline hooks
            and in fishing gillnets. Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe,
            and therefore many drown once caught. Known as bycatch, this is a serious
            threat to leatherback turtles. As fishing activity expands, this
            threat is more of a problem.</p>
