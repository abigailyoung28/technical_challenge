        <section class="text_section">
          <div class="leftText">
          <p>Javan rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species,
            with only around 60 individuals that live only in Ujung Kulon National
            Park in Java, Indonesia. Javan rhinos once lived throughout northeast
            India and Southeast Asia. Vietnam’s last Javan rhino was poached in 2010.
            The population in Ujung Kulon National Park represents the only hope for
            the survival of a species that is on the brink of extinction.
            Javan rhinos were killed by trophy hunters during colonial times.
            They were also killed as agricultural pests and for their horn,
            a highly prized commodity in traditional Asian medicine.
            Poaching remains an ever-present threat.
            People living near the park are encroaching on and degrading crucial
            rhino habitat. Important economic development near the park,
            including from (eco)tourism, risks further encroachment into the park.</p>
