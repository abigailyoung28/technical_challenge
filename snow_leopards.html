          <p>The snow leopard’s powerful build allows it to scale great steep
            slopes with ease. Its hind legs give the snow leopard the ability
            to leap six times the length of its body. A long tail provides balance
             and agility and also wraps around the resting snow leopard as protection
             from the cold. For millennia, the mountains were rich with their prey
             such as blue sheep, Argali wild sheep, ibex, marmots, pikas and hares.
             Snow leopards are found in 12 countries but their
             population is dropping. Climate change poses perhaps the greatest
             long-term threat to snow leopards. Impacts from climate change
             could result in a loss of up to 30 percent of the snow leopard
             habitat in the Himalayas alone. Snow leopards are often killed by
             local farmers because they prey on livestock such as sheep, goats,
             horses, and yak calves. The animals which snow leopards would typically
             hunt—such as the Argali sheep—are also hunted by local communities.
             As their natural prey becomes harder to find, snow leopards are
             forced to kill livestock for survival.</p>
