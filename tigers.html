          <div class="leftText">
          <p>Tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for
            hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. On average, tigers
            give birth to two to four cubs every two years. If all the cubs in one
            litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months. About
            half of all cubs do not survive more than two years.
            Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild.
            Tigers have lost an estimated 95% of their historical range.
            Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded, and fragmented by human
            activities. The clearing of forests for agriculture and timber, as
            well as the building of road networks and other development activities,
            pose serious threats to tiger habitats. Tigers need wide swaths of
            habitat for their survival since they have large home ranges and are
            very territorial. Fewer tigers can survive in small, scattered islands
            of habitat, which leads to a higher risk of inbreeding and makes tigers
            more vulnerable to poaching as they venture beyond protected areas to
            establish their territories. This underscores the need to ensure habitat
            connectivity between the protected areas where tigers live.</p>
